These are notes on using git


git clone URL OF THE REPO

-NEVER CLONE INTO A REPO


When modify or make changes --> always save!!! 

git add "." or "file name"  or "-A" --> adds to staging

git commit -m "meaningful message to help understand what was committed" 

git pull origin main "best to pull before the push when working with others to avoid overlap etc"

git push origin main 

git status --> tells you whats going on
